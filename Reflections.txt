Our presence in this temporal plane is evanescent, ephemoral, and etherial.  Even so, we strive.  I have been blessed in my short life to have shared long segments of the road with very special people.  Some of them have arrived at their destination before me.  I pray that God granths them His Grace.  I pray that my actions might be worthy of the sacrifices they made to bring me to my present station in life.
